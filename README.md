Problem: 
- The deadline of the world is decreasing due to bad habits and at times while not aware. Overheating water shortage and sea extinction are a huge problem.

Objective:
- To spread this app to other universities and educate people while creating solutions to a worldwide problem.

Solution:
- To inform students about the impact each food has especially the contrast between different menu options in their school making them take more opinionated choices.

The project started with research, user experience, user interface and also the design system. All this part can be viewed on [Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/158895019/Eco-friendly-Canteen-App). 

For mobile development the programming language dart and flutter was used. can be viewed [Here](https://github.com/isabellabertucci/CantecoMobileApp)

The Canteco app used the implementation of the [CantecoRestApi](https://github.com/isabellabertucci/CantecoRestApi).

For help in developing Flutter, it was consulted in the [online documentation](https://canteco-api.onrender.com/doc/), which offers tutorials, samples, guidance for using the full API.
